# Machine Learning Testbed Platform (Incremental Build)

## Overview

This project aims to create a flexible and configurable machine learning testbed platform. The platform will allow users to train, validate, and test machine learning models against various components. This version of the project description outlines a plan for building the platform incrementally, starting with core functionalities and progressively adding more advanced features based on a revised set of user stories.

## Goals

The primary goal is to develop a robust and extensible platform for ML experimentation. This will be achieved by implementing functionalities step-by-step, ensuring each feature is well-tested and integrated before moving to the next.

## Incremental Development Approach

The project will be built by implementing user stories sequentially. Each user story represents a small, achievable step towards the overall platform functionality. This approach allows for continuous progress, easier debugging, and clearer understanding of dependencies between features.

## Key Features (to be built incrementally)

*   **Basic Data Loading:** Start with loading simple, built-in datasets.
*   **Simple Model Definition:** Define and train a basic model.
*   **Core Training Loop:** Implement a fundamental training and evaluation process.
*   **Basic Metrics:** Calculate and report essential metrics like loss and accuracy.
*   **Configuration:** Introduce a basic configuration mechanism (e.g., using YAML).
*   **Extending Functionality:** Gradually add support for more complex datasets, models, optimizers, metrics, and training features as defined in the user stories.
*   **Experiment Tracking:** Integrate with tools like Weights & Biases.
*   **Comparing Evaluation Outcomes:** Ability to compare results of different runs on the same dataset and identify overlapping correctly classified samples.
*   **High-Dimensional Visualization:** Support for visualizing high-dimensional data (e.g., embeddings) using techniques like t-SNE or UMAP, with configurable options.
*   **Advanced Features:** Implement hyperparameter optimization, hardware acceleration, and parallel processing.
