# Machine Learning Testbed Platform - Incremental User Stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to train and test a simple fully connected neural network against the MNIST dataset.: Completed

2. As a user, I want to see a progress bar for each epoch during training. After each iteration, the progress bar should disappear and be replaced with a single line like: {epoch:>3} - ({train_time:>6.2f},{test_time:>6.2f}) - training accuracy {train_accuracy:>5.2f} ({best_accuracy:>5.2f}) - training loss {train_loss:>6.4f} ({best_loss:>6.4f}) - test accuracy {test_accuracy:>5.2f} ({best_test_accuracy:>5.2f}) - test loss {test_loss:>6.4f} ({best_test_loss:>6.4f}). Each epoch should be numbered.: Completed

3. As a user, I want to be able to configure whether to use CPU or GPU for training and testing.: Completed
